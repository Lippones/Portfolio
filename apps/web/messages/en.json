With 2 years of experience as a Full Stack Developer, I possess skills that range from initial conception to final implementation. I work both for the company I am employed with and as a freelancer. My interest is not limited to just formal employment; I am always on the lookout to create and develop new micro SaaS (Software as a Service) and independent projects. These side endeavors not only hone my skills but also allow me to explore new ideas and innovative solutions to everyday problems. I believe technology has the power to transform lives and businesses. I am eager to collaborate with teams and projects that share this vision and are in search of a developer who brings both technical knowledge and a creative perspective to the table. If you are looking for someone who can combine technical competency with a creative approach to software development, let's talk. Together, we can turn ideas into reality.",
